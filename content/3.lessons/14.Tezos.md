# Workshop - Deploying Smart Contracts on Tezos

‚úîÔ∏è Understand the basics of Tezos smart contracts

‚úîÔ∏è Learn how to write a simple smart contract for Tezos

‚úîÔ∏è Deploy your contract to the Tezos blockchain

## Introduction

Tezos is a self-amending cryptographic ledger that can evolve by upgrading itself over time without having to hard fork. This makes it an ideal platform for building decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts with long-term viability. Smart contracts on Tezos are primarily written in a language called Michelson, but higher-level languages like SmartPy and Ligo can also be used, which then compile down to Michelson.

In this workshop, we will explore how to create a simple smart contract and deploy it to the Tezos blockchain. We'll use SmartPy, a Python-based language for Tezos smart contracts, for its readability and ease of use.

This workshop draws inspiration from various resources and the vibrant Tezos developer community. After this workshop, you'll have a solid foundation to start building more complex DApps on Tezos.

## Step 0: Setup

Ensure you have the necessary tools and accounts set up:

- Install [SmartPy](https://smartpy.io/docs/)
- Set up a [Tezos Wallet](https://tezbox.com/) for deployment and transactions
- Access to a Tezos testnet faucet for test tokens

## Step 1: Write a Smart Contract

### üìë **Description**:

We will create a simple smart contract called `HelloTezos`, which stores a message on the blockchain that can be updated by anyone.

### üìå **Tasks**:

- Use SmartPy to define a contract that has a single storage variable: `message`.
- Implement an entry point `updateMessage` that allows changing the `message` stored in the contract.
- Test your contract in the SmartPy online IDE to ensure it behaves as expected.

### üìö **Documentation**:

- [SmartPy Documentation](https://smartpy.io/docs/)
- [Tezos Smart Contract Overview](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtodevelop.html)

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Validation**:

Test your contract in the SmartPy IDE using various scenarios to ensure it behaves correctly. The `message` should update appropriately when the `updateMessage` function is called.

## Step 2: Deploy the Contract

### üìë **Description**:

Once your contract is written and tested, the next step is to deploy it to the Tezos blockchain.

### üìå **Tasks**:

- Compile your SmartPy contract to Michelson.
- Use your Tezos wallet to deploy the contract to the Tezos testnet.
- Interact with your deployed contract using a Tezos client or through the SmartPy IDE to ensure it's functioning correctly.

### üìö **Documentation**:

- [Deploying SmartPy Contracts](https://smartpy.io/docs/cli/)
- [Interacting with Tezos Contracts](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtoget.html)

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Validation**:

Verify that your contract is live on the Tezos testnet by interacting with it. You should be able to update the `message` and see the changes on the blockchain.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully written and deployed a smart contract to the Tezos blockchain. This is just the beginning of what's possible with Tezos. From here, you can explore more complex contract structures, participate in the Tezos community, and start building your DApps on this innovative platform.
